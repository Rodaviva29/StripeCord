**The Ultimate Discord Bot for Seamless Subscription Management with Stripe!**

StripeCord is a simple, free solution to seamlessly integrate Stripe and Discord. It connects directly to the Stripe API, with no extra fees involved. All your customers need to do is enter the email address they used for their Stripe subscription via a Discord command, and they‚Äôll get instant access. Plus, the bot automatically checks every X hours to ensure all subscriptions are still valid.
