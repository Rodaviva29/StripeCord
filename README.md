**The Ultimate Discord Bot for Seamless Subscription Management with Stripe!**

StripeCord is a simple, free solution to seamlessly integrate Stripe and Discord. It connects directly to the Stripe API, with no extra fees involved. All your customers need to do is enter the email address they used for their Stripe subscription via a Discord command, and theyâ€™ll get instant access. Plus, the bot automatically checks every X hours to ensure all subscriptions are still valid.

## ðŸ§ª Beta Notes  
- Stripe Cord is having a big overhaul w/ support for multiple roles and +, check Stripe Cord V2 in [Dev Branch](https://github.com/Rodaviva29/StripeCord/tree/dev).
- Latest dev is a **Release Candidate** for V2, not a full release. Breaking errors may occur, please report them in my Discord DM `Rodaviva` â€” Iâ€™d greatly appreciate it!

If anyone would like to help the project, I would be grateful if you could make PRs or create a issue for enhancement features or bugs found. Any [Ko-Fis](https://ko-fi.com/rodaviva) given would be greatly welcome to allow me to continue to mantain this project development.

Core concept inspired by [Androz2091/stripe-discord-bot](https://github.com/Androz2091/stripe-discord-bot).

This version uses JavaScript instead of TypeScript and noSQL (MongoDB) instead of SQL. Want to switch to SQL? Just give me a thumbs up and Iâ€™ll create a branch for you!
